# Extreme ester Hydrolysis
As we explore physical organic chemistry we can investigate seemingly simple reactions and observe surprising complexity. This webbook is a collection of documents and data analysis exploring the acid hydrolysis of esters. There are several possible mechanisms that can consume the starting material depending on the structure of the ester and the strength of the acidic conditions. We will be considering acid mixtures far beyond where the pH scale has meaning. Lets get extreme, together.

### [Yates \& McClellan, 1967](tba)

I first began this line of thought after presenting some work of Keith Yates (1928-2006) and Robert McClelland performed at the University of Toronto and reported in 1967. Both had long careers at U of T and McClelland continues there as a Professor Emeritus.

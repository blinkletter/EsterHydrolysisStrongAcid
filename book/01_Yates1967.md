# Discussion of Yates \& McClellan, 1967

I first began this line of thought after presenting some work of Keith Yates (1928-2006) and Robert McClelland performed at the University of Toronto and reported in 1967. Both had long careers at U of T and McClelland continues there as a Professor Emeritus.

"Mechanisms of ester hydrolysis in aqueous sulfuric acids." K. Yates, R.A. McClelland, *J. Am. Chem. Soc.*, **1967**, *89*, 2686-2692. https://doi.org/10.1021/ja00987a033

This paper presents a complicated relationship between reactivity and acidity. It also provides evidence supporting an idea that ester hydrolysis is second-order in water. I worked through the data in the paper and presented an analysis of the results for methyl acetate in the following documents.

# Models for $a_{H_2O} and More

To analyze the data in the paper of Yates and McClellan I needed a way to match the

[Models_aH2O_and_More.pdf](pdf/Models_aH2O_and_More.pdf) - This document explores the idea of creating polynomial curve fits for the data sets discussed in the [interpolation page](02_interpolating.md). In the end I settled on a better form of interpolation. The following notebooks contain the code for the plots and data analysis.

- [Figures 2 \& 3](notebooks/03_Yates-MeOAc-Data.ipynb) - Plots of the following...
   - Figure 2: Plot of $k_{obs}$ vs $\%H_2SO_4$ for methyl acetate using data from the tables in the paper and data picked from the image of the plot that included the extra data points.
   - Figure 3: Plot of differences between reported and digitized data for $k_{obs}$ vs $\%H_2SO_4$ using data from the tables in the paper and data picked from the image of the plot that included the extra data points.
- [Figure 8](notebooks/03_Bell-EtOAc-Data2.ipynb) - Plots of the following...
    - Figure 8: Plot of data for $k_{obs}$ vs $\%H_2SO_4$ for all the data sets, including ethyl acetate and the restored three points for methyl acetate.

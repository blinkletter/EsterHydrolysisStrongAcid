# Interpolating Literature Data Sets

I wanted to analyze the data using data sets for $H_0$ and $a_{H_2O} from sources other that the values reported in Yates \& McClellan, 1967. If the values in a data set did not align with those used by the authors we will need to use interpolation to estimate the values in the spaces between data points.

[EsterAcidHydrolysisExploration.pdf](pdf/Interpolators_1.pdf) - This document presents efforts to understand and use interpolation in data sets. Calculations and figures presented in this exploration are documented in the *Python* notebook below.

- [Figures](notebooks/02_Yates-interpolators.ipynb) - Plots of the following...
    - Figure 1: Plot of data for $a_{H_2O}$ vs \%wt $\%{H_2SO_4}$ with interpolation line; plot of \%differential between data and interpolation.
    - Figure 2: Plot of data for $H_0$ vs \%wt ${H_2SO_4}$ with interpolation line; plot of \%differential between data and interpolation.
    - Figure 3: Plot of data for density vs \%wt ${H_2SO_4}$ with interpolation line; plot of \%differential between data and interpolation.
